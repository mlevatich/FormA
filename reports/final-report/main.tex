\section{Introduction}

    Our aim was to design, program, and verify via model-checking a lightweight
	video game called \Name{}, \emph{Formal verified Asteroids}.
	\Name is based loosely on the classic arcade game \textit{Asteroids}
    \cite{asteroids}; the player controls a small spaceship, viewed from a
    top-down perspective, and must avoid or shoot down incoming asteroids from
    all directions.

    \Name{} is implemented in C, with the help of the low-level rendering and
    audio library \sdl{}. We used \cbmc{} \cite{clarke2004tool} to model-check
    certain properties of the game as we developed it, including memory safety,
    collision pruning correctness, velocity limits, and sprite boundary zones.

    \subsection{Deliverables}

        We submit:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item{The game's code and assets}
            \item{Build instructions, including how to invoke \cbmc{}}
            \item{A final project report detailing our process and a correctness
            specification of the properties checked}
        \end{enumerate}

        We also created demo videos of our gameplay, available in two versions:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The basic gameplay video, available at link \url{
        			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcLxyKBAmO4
            }
            \item The gameplay video with ``bounded boxes'' used for collision detection, available at link \url{
        			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIl8qvB_IzI
            }
        \end{itemize}

            \label{fig:gameplay}
        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Comparison with our proposal}

        As we laid out in our project proposal, we successfully implemented
        \Name{} (Figure~\ref{fig:gameplay}), a safe and finely tuned variant of
        \textit{Asteroids}, entirely from scratch with an eye towards model
        checking through the whole development process. \Name{} surpasses the
        original game in features, and is comparable in scope to modern variants
        found on the internet, complete with scoring, sound effects, original
        music, six degrees of freedom per sprite, and robust collision detection.
        Furthermore, we model-check a number of technically non-trivial and
        practically useful properties of the game using \cbmc{}, including
        properties not mentioned in our proposal, which we came up with during
        development. \cbmc{} and \texttt{clang-tidy}, paired with our other
        testing approaches, allowed us to find subtle bugs in our
        implementation, such as memory leaks and overly permissive collision
        detection.

        While the game as written is fully featured and fun to play, we were not
        able to pursue the extensions discussed in our proposal, such as
        non-fatal collisions with "bouncy" objects, or objects with their own
        gravitational fields. While these features would certainly be cool, we
        feel that \Name{} as written, coming in at 1000 lines of code, is
        complex enough to present interesting model-checking challenges for
        the purposes of CSEE 6863.

    \subsection{Author contributions}

        Both authors contributed equally to the project. Max focused
        on writing the game loop and interfacing with SDL for graphics and
        audio, and defining the \sdl{} interface for \texttt{mockSDL.h}. Harry
        focused on determining appropriate logic formulas to verify,
        implementing those formulas, and instrumenting our build to support
        \cbmc{} and \texttt{clang-tidy}. Both authors worked on the core
        collision detection algorithms, as well as drafting the reports and
        presentation.

\section{Game overview}

    \subsection{Development environment}

        \Name{} is written in C (C11 standard) and depends only on \cbmc{} and
        Simple DirectMedia Layer 2.0 (\sdl{}), along with supplementary
        extensions \texttt{SDL Mixer} and \texttt{SDL TTF}. \sdl{} is a
        development library written in C which provides a simple low-level
        interface to the keyboard, audio, and graphics hardware necessary to
        program a video game.

        The assets for the game were drawn in GIMP, and the original music and
        sound effects were created using FamiStudio.

    \subsection{The game}

        In \Name{}, the player uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to
        control a ``spaceship''. The up arrow applies a force to the ship in the
        direction that it is facing, while the left and right arrows turn the
        ship in place. This allows the player to navigate a 2D plane with six
        degrees of freedom: x-position, y-position, x-velocity, y-velocity,
        rotation, and angular velocity. The plane wraps around, so piloting the
        ship off one edge of the screen will see it re-emerge on the other side.

        Circular asteroids spawn randomly outside of the boundaries of the
        space with random inward velocities. If the ship collides with an
        asteroid, the game is over. If asteroids collide with each other, they
        break into four fragments, which are still capable of destroying the
        ship.

        The player can press the spacebar to shoot a laser from the spaceship
        in the direction the ship is facing. A bar in the top left of the
        screen represents the "cooldown" time before the player can fire a laser
        again. Lasers which collide with asteroids will break them into four
        fragments, deleting the laser. Lasers which collide with asteroid
        fragments delete both the fragment and the laser. In this way, the
        player can clear space for themselves by carefully aiming laser shots.

        The player's performance is measured by a score in the top left of the
        screen. The score increases passively each frame, so that they player
        is rewarded for staying alive. The score also increases when the player
        destroys asteroids with lasers, and this is the main mechanism for
        gaining points. The score achieved is written to the console when the
        player loses.

        As the score increases, the difficulty of the game increases. The
        maximum number of on-screen asteroids and their average velocity
        increase linearly with the score. The cooldown of the ship's laser also
        decreases, however, so the player can fire more lasers to deal with the
        high number of asteroids and earn points faster.

        The game can be launched in debug mode using the \texttt{-d} flag, which
        slows down the game and renders both the bounding boxes used for
        collision and the sprite origins.

    \subsection{Core algorithms}

        \subsubsection{Game loop}

            We use the traditional game programming technique of a \textit{game
            loop}, where the running program consists mainly of an infinite
            loop, and each iteration of the loop represents one \textit{frame},
            in which we read \textit{user input}, \textit{update} the game state
            according to the input, and \textit{render} the game state to the
            screen. This approach is amenable to model checking - all of the
            code which renders the game state is abstracted away, and we write
            properties which reason about the state struct and the transitions
            occuring in the \textit{update} function, which is the only part of
            the code that modifies the state.

        \subsubsection{Collision detection}

            The central algorithm of \Name{} is collision detection. We use a
            traditional but highly precise algorithm in which each sprite in the
            game is associated with an array of rectangles which tightly
            approximate the shape of the sprite in local coordinates. On each
            frame of the game, every pair of sprites is checked for collision;
            For a single pair, every pair of bounding boxes (translated from
            local coordinates), is checked for overlap.

            This is typically done because checking whether two axis-aligned
            rectangles overlap is extremely fast, but multiple rectangles
            together can still closely approximate any shape. When sprites
            rotate, however, as ours do, the bounding boxes must rotate with
            them, and thus an arbitrary pair of bounding boxes is not
            necessarily axis-aligned. In this case, to check whether the boxes
            overlap, we compute the positions of the box corners rotated around
            the sprite center, and make use of the Separating Axis Theorem,
            which states that two convex objects do not overlap if there exists
            an axis onto which the two objects' projections do not overlap. This
            axis, if it exists, will be parallel to one of the objects' edges,
            so for two bounding boxes, we have four candidate separating axes.
            If any axis admits non-overlapping projections, the two boxes do
            not touch, and if no pair of boxes touches for a given pair of
            sprites, the sprites do not touch.

            The many layers of this algorithm motivate a model checking approach
            which gives the programmer confidence that the algorithm works as
            intended (Section 3.1).

            In our proposal, we set out to explore classical collision detection
            optimizations such as bounding volume hierarchies (BVH), which prune
            the $n^2$ space of all potential sprite collisions into a set of
            \textit{candidate} collisions for objects which are efficiently
            determined to be reasonably close \cite{moore1988collision,
            palmer1995collision}. Unfortunately, we did not have time to pursue
            these optimzations, but \Name{} is not computationally demanding
            enough to need them; the game still runs without noticeable lag.

\section{Correctness specification}
\label{sec:properties}

    We chose several CTL properties to check for our game. The specifications
    changed and grew as we discovered what kinds of properties we can
    effectively check, and we came up with the following CTL formulas for model
    checking.

    \subsection{Collision handling}

        $$AG(\forall obj. obj \neq ship \implies \lnot touching(obj,ship))$$
        In practice, we had to approximate this property by having two separate
        collision handling checks: an \emph{underapproximation} and an
        \emph{overapproximation}. This is detailed further in Section
        \ref{sec:collision}.

        Collision Detection was the main property we were model checking.
        \textcolor{red}{
            TODO
        }
        \textcolor{blue}{
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Collision detection is hard
                \item Overapproximation
                \item Underapporximation
            \end{itemize}
        }

    \subsection{Input correspondance}

        $AG(keydown(UP) \implies ship.fx = -sin(ship.theta) * ACCEL\_NORM
                        \land ship.fy = cos(ship.theta) * ACCEL\_NORM)$

        $AG(keydown(LEFT) \land \lnot keydown(RIGHT) \implies ship.omega = ANGULAR\_VEL)$

        $AG(keydown(RIGHT) \land \lnot keydown(LEFT) \implies ship.omega = -ANGULAR\_VEL)$

        $AG(keydown(LEFT) \land keydown(RIGHT) \implies ship.omega = 0)$

	\subsection{Asteroid leaves screen}

		\begin{align*}
			AG((asteroid.x < 0 \lor end < asteroid.x) \land
			(asteroid.y < 0 \lor end < asteroid.y))
		\end{align*}

    \subsection{Asteroids always exist}
    \[AG(asteroids != NULL)\]

    \subsection{Ship is always in screen}
    \begin{gather*}
        -shipWidth \leq shipX \land shipX \leq SCREEN\_WIDTH + shipWidth \land \\
        -shipHeight \leq shipY \land shipY \leq SCREEN\_HEIGHT + shipHeight
    \end{gather*}

    \subsection{Laser is always faster than ship}
    $$AG(shipVelocity~<~laserVelocity)$$

\section{Verification and testing}

    To verify our correctness specification (Section 3) and gain general
    confidence in our implementation, we used the C Bounded Model Checker
    (\cbmc{}), as well as \texttt{clang-tidy} and a handwritten debug mode in
    which to play the game. CBMC is capable of statically checking the
    validity of assertions in a C program by unrolling paths through the
    program.

    We expressed the propositional logic formulas in our correctness
    specification as assertions, preconditions, and postconditions in code, such
    that CBMC could check them. These assertions are invoked on every iteration
    of the \textit{game loop}, such that from a zoomed-out perspective where
    each frame of the game is a state transition, they can be viewed as AG()
    CTL formulas.

	We integrated CBMC as a developmental procedure, just like regression
    testing might be used in a software development cycle. Creating the
    assertions themselves helped with the design process, and model checking
    gave confidence that we wrote the correct implementation with respect to the
    specification.

    \subsection{Debug mode}

        As part of our testing approach, we added a flag to the game which runs
        it in debug mode. This allowed us to slow down the game and see
        precisely when collisions happen, by rendering bounding boxes around
        each sprite. Collision detection algorithms often suffer from small
        errors which are not noticeable in normal fast-paced gameplay, so the
        debug mode gave us visual intuition we needed that the algorithms are
        correct.

    \subsection{Comparison with \texttt{clang-tidy}}

        We also employed the tool \texttt{clang-tidy} to catch possible bugs
        through static analysis. Most notably, it was able to show a null
        pointer dereference that we had in our code
        (Figure~\ref{fig:clang-tidy}). This dereference surprisingly caused a
        segmentation fault on some testing machines, but not others, so it
        would have been a pernicious bug to track down without static analysis.

        \begin{figure}[h!]
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{clang-tidy.png}
            \caption{Using \texttt{clang-tidy}}
            \label{fig:clang-tidy}
        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Using \cbmc{}}

        \subsubsection{Faking out \cbmc{} with NoSDL}

            In order to use \cbmc{}, we were forced to de-couple the
            implementation of our game with its graphical implementation.
            When we try to invoke \cbmc{} on the \sdl{} library, even with
            the simplest code listing as below:

            \begin{verbatim}
            #include<SDL2/SDL.h>
            int main(){}
            \end{verbatim}

            We receive an error as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cbmc-sdl}, even
            though the code runs properly.

            \begin{figure}[h!]
                \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cbmc-sdl.png}
                \caption{Error with SDL2 and CBMC}
                \label{fig:cbmc-sdl}
            \end{figure}

            We decided to create a mock interface that has the same definitions
            of the library, without their implementations, since we were not
            interested in checking the correctness of the \sdl{}.
            A sample mock interface is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mock-sdl}, where
            the SDL functions we use are all no-op functions or return
            \texttt{NULL}. This allowed us to decouple the implementation of
            SDL (which presumably has some errors in model checking against the
            default \cbmc{} settings) and the actual implementation of our
            project.

            It additionally helped us to clarify which pieces of SDL were being
            used in our code, and encouraged us to minimize our interface with
            the library, a good coding practice in general.

            \begin{figure}[h!]
                \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{mock-sdl.png}
                \caption{MockSDL Interface}
                \label{fig:mock-sdl}
            \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Writing good properties}

            We found that writing properties was actually difficult -- creating
            the specification of the project was a major problem. What property
            do we want to check in the game? We had to think of possible bugs
            that can happen in the game. What is the ``specification'' of the
            game?

            Ultimately, we were able to come up with several properties that we
            describe in Section~\ref{sec:properties}.

        \subsubsection{Limited size checking of BMC}
            As with all code, our codebase heavily relies on loops, and this
            exploded the size of our problem. Even when we ran loops with depth
            $2$, they were heavily nested and took more than ten minutes to run.

            This became even more an issue when we wanted to check for
            \emph{reachability properties}. When we wanted to check the property
            that ``every asteroid eventually leaves the screen,'' we could not
            write this reachability property directly, so we wanted to model
            check it for a large number of bounds, e.g. $100$. However, this
            made the automata size very large, and caused the model checker to
            run out of memory (Figure~\ref{fig:killed}). Eventually, we had to
            make do without adding this property into our check.

            \begin{figure}[h!]
                \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{killed.png}
                \caption{Out of Memory}
                \label{fig:killed}
            \end{figure}

            Additionally, we wanted to check properties that are preserved
            across different functions calls (e.g. that the plane and the laser
            never collide), and so it was not always possible to instantiate
            environment assumptions for each function call.

        \subsubsection{Debugging long error traces}

            When we were able to find violations in our properties, we found
            that the counterexample traces that we found were very long. For
            instance, for checking that our ship was in bounds, we obtained a
            counterexample trace (cf. Appendix ~\ref{appendix:trace}) that was
            $199$ transitions long, This made debugging the property very
            difficult, even when using the \texttt{--compact-trace} option --
            although it perhaps represents a subtle error that we would not have
            been able to obtain without formal verification.
